From powerpoints fron CyberPatriot https://docs.google.com/document/d/1dDJA3Go5ujMKW9vBFOBttLSg1UTz-xcX7ElfGnN37OM/edit  https://s3.amazonaws.com/cpvii/Training+materials/Unit+Eight+-+Ubuntu+Security.pdf


Basic Graphical User Interface (GUI) security

User settings 
Go to system settings (in menu bar click the gear with the wrench)
then go to user accounts(it's at the lower right hand corner and has two people)
click unlock(it's on the top right hand corner and has a unlocked lock)
it will ask you for a password(password is password)
switch user from administrator to standard(click next to account type the first one)
change passwords (by clicking next to passwords on the astericks)

Enabiling updates (do enabiling updates first but don't update version will mess with scoring)

First click the Ubuntu button(it's the first thing on the menu bar it's also reddish and has a ring with 3 circles)
Then search update manager(it's "Update Manager"  
If that doesn't show anything then try goint to the top bar at the top right and click the gear icon and go to software update and then at the lower right hand corner click settings)
To set automatic updates first go to the updates tab(it's on the top bar and is the third one from the left)
then make sure automaticlly check for updates is set for daily(it is the first setting with a dropdown menu)
then apply changes(don't click revert it resets all the settings to defult)
lastly update all availible settings do this at the end because it will take time(go to the main update manager window which is just the first tab)
Make sure you don't update the version of ubuntu this will mess up the scoring and will disqualify you
